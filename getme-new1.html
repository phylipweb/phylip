<EM> Note</EM> -- you probably need the full PHYLIP package, including
the source code and documents in some form, simply in order
to make sure that you have the documentation, even if you do 
not intend to ever recompile the source
code.  Most Windows and MacOS users will want to use the
executables for their
machines and will not need to recompile the source code,
but everyone will need the documentation as well.  Whenever PHYLIP
is packaged as a single archive, it does include the all of the
source code and documentation.
<P>
The Windows executables, documents, and sources
are in the form of a Zip archive.  To extract it,
put it in a directory by itself and right-click on the
icon of the archive.  You will then be given the 
option to unpack the archive
into the many files of the package.
<P>
The Mac OS X package is distributed as a <tt>.dmg</tt> Disk Image which
can be unpacked using the instructions on our installation web page.
<! The Mac OS 9 archives will (hopefully) be automatically unpacked -->
<! when they are transferred. -->
The Linux executables can easily be compiled
after downloading the source code -- see the installation page here.

<TD BGCOLOR="beige">PHYLIP's license is changing to an open-source license.  It
now uses a license that allows re-use in other software packages without
demanding a royalty. (It does not demand that all other software in that
distribution be open-source). The source code tar archive below has the new
license. I have designated it as a new version, 3.698.

<LI><A HREF="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/download/phylip-3.697.tar.gz">gzip'ed tar archive of C sources and documentation</A>

(see below for information on how to compile these, and for
information on precompiled Linux and Unix executables).
<P>
<H2>Windows</H2>
<P>
We have here the PHYLIP package for Windows, which works on
all versions of Windows from Windows 3.1 to Windows 10.
Executables, documentation files, and
source code is included in this distribution. 
<P>
PHYLIP for Windows is available here in two forms.  You will
need only one of these, so read carefully before downloading.  If you
click on one of these selections to download it, make sure your browser
saves it to disk.  After
downloading, but before you do anything
else, you should read
<a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/install.html">our installation instructions</a>.

If you have a recent Windows system that is able to extract a ZIP
that file, and if you can transfer a file that is about 12 
megabytes in size, you will want to download this
zip archive, and then right-click on it to see an option to unzip the
archive.
<ul>
<li> If you have (as most people do) a 64-bit Windows system, use this Zip archive:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/download/phylip-3.698.zip">
Zip archive of PHYLIP 3.698 for Windows</a>.
<li> If you have an older Windows system that is a 32-bit system,<br> then
you will need to use this older version that was compiled for 32-bit systems:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/download/phylip-3.695.zip">
Zip archive of PHYLIP 3.695 for Windows</a>.
</ul>
<P>
<H2>Mac OS</H2>
<P>
For Macintosh Mac OS (either Intel iMac or PowerMac) the package is distributed as a single compressed
disk image (.DMG) file of 12 Megabytes.  Click on this link to download it:
<P>
<A HREF="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/download/phylip-3.695-osx.dmg">Documentation, source code and executables</A>
<P>
After PHYLIP is installed, the most recent Mac OS X operating system versions,
from Mountain Lion on, may refuse to run its executables when you click on the program
icon.  There is a good workaround for this -- see the discussion at
<a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/install.html">our
installation web page</a>.

<H3>Debian linux executables</H3>
<P>
Andreas Tille and Manuel Prinz have compiled and made available a set of PHYLIP
3.695 executables for Debian Linux.
These are in the "unstable" section of Debian packages
and may be downloaded for free ("free in the sense of free beer") from
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/phylip">
its page on the Debian web site</A> at
<CODE>http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/phylip</CODE>.
or from various Debian mirror sites.  Of course, one can also install
the source code (see under Unix above) and compile it yourself.
<P>
<h3>Executables for FreeBSD</h3>
<P>
A PHYLIP 3.695 package for FreeBSD Unix is available, thanks to David Bader
and others. It is located at
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/biology/phylip/">the BSD PHYLIP package web page</A> at
<code>http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/biology/phylip/</code>.

<h3>Source distribution for NetBSD</h3>

A set of sources and executables for PHYLIP 3.69 for
the NetBSD operating system has been produced (originally by Marc Baudoin).  They are available from
